            The Difference Between Coding in Google Docs VS an HTML Document.
        </header>
            <p>
                Google Docs and HTML documents server very different purposes and experiences. The first, and most obvious difference, is the intended use. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Google Docs is a program that is designed for editing, drafting, and collaborating on text documents. Similar to Word, or Pages, Google Docs sole purpose is to produce text-based files.
                On the other hand, an HTML document is used for the development of web pages. An HTML document consists of tags and commands that define what will be on a web browser.
                When it comes to what these documents produce, there are also major differences. Google Docs will <em>only</em> produce static text documents. They are typically in Word or PDF files, and remain non-interactive.
                HTML documents produce rendered web pages. These web pages are can be interactive, as they can include features such as images, links, buttons, and other forms of content.
            </p>

            <p>
                To conclude, Googles Docs is an ideal program for writing static, non-interactive, amd informative text documents. HTML documents will be needed if you intend to create functional, interactive, and visually appealing web browsers.

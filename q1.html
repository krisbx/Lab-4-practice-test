                I want to write about nostalgia because I've been experiencing it a lot more lately. It's a really bittersweet feeling, sometime <em>that certain smell</em> of baked goods will bring you a happy memory of your trips to an aunts house, and sometimes <strong>that one song</strong> gives you a pit in your stomach as you remember how it played when your friend cut you off for good.
                Nostalgia can really be a double-edged sword. I personally feel that even if you feel sadness or longing for a moment long gone, it still allows you to appreciate your past and the roads you've taken to the present as much as the happy memories do.

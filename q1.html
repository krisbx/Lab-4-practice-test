                I want to write about nostalgia because I've been experiencing it a lot more lately. It's a really bittersweet feeling, sometime <em>that certain smell</em> of baked goods will bring you a happy memory of your trips to an aunts house, and sometimes <strong>that one song</strong> gives you a pit in your stomach as you remember how it played when your friend cut you off for good.
                Nostalgia can really be a double-edged sword. I personally feel that even if you feel sadness or longing for a moment long gone, it still allows you to appreciate your past and the roads you've taken to the present as much as the happy memories do.

                    Upon some research, there appears to be several issues with the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags. The most known one is the accessibility problem, where screen readers struggle to interpret the text within the tags.
                    This leads to a loss of context for those with visual or other reading impairments. This leads into the fact that the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags lack semantic meaning. They are known for being purely visual, whereas &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags include the context, or meaning of the enclosed text.
                    The last reason is a bit more niche, but by using &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; over &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;, once your code becomes lengthy and requires updates, you may lose the image of what text is "visually" bold, and what text is actually important.
